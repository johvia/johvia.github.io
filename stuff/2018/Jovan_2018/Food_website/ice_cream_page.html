		<p class='content'>Ice cream is a wonderful treat for a warm summer day because it is cold refreshing. I believe that the best Ice cream flavour is
		spearmint and the worst flavour is salty caramel ice cream. Another reason why I like ice cream is that you can find it at most places for example 
		in your fridge or from the supermarket. Ice cream can also come to in a truck known as an ice cream truck, which notifies with song when it is near.
		Although Ice cream is nice it does not work for every season unlike pizza because ice cream's flavour isn't good enough to withstand the cold when you 
		eat it in winter. One thing thing that I really like about ice cream is that you can change it's container without it seeming weird.
