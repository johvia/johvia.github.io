		<p class='content'>Biltong is a dried, cured meat that originated in Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe and South Africa. Biltong is the best out of my three
		favourite foods. Biltong is very similar to beef jerky, which is also nice, but the ingredients and production of biltong are different to beef jerky 
		and I think the biltong variant is the better one. I think biltong is most famous in South Africa, which is where I was born and made me exposed to it.
		Biltong consists of the ingredients of meat, vinegar, black pepper, coriander and salt. I think the best type of meat to use for biltong is wildebeest
		but the worst type is fish biltong.</p>
