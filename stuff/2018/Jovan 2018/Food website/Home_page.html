			<h3>Pizza</h3>
			<br>
			<p class='minitext'> 
			I chose pizza because it has melted cheese, you can put pineapple on it, it is cheap and you make people bring it to you. I believe
			the best toppings you can get on a pizza is pineapple and ham.</p>
		</div>
		<div class='textboxDivtwo'>
			<p class='minitexttwo'> The pizza I'm referring to is known as the Hawaiian, which isn't the picture I'm displaying.
			I really like that people can order a pizza and then have someone deliver it to you but the delivery might take too long and your pizza might get cold,
			which is also good because pizza is good at any temperature. I also like that how you can choose what goes on your pizza. I especially love
			the melted cheese on pizza because I love melted ...</p>

			<h3>Ice Cream</h3>
			<br>
			<p class='minitext'>Ice cream is a wonderful treat for a warm summer day because it is cold refreshing. I believe that the best Ice cream flavour is
			spearmint and the worst flavour is salty caramel ice cream. Another reason </p>
		</div>
		<div class='textboxDivtwo'>
			<p class='minitexttwo'>why I like ice cream is that you can find it at most places for example 
			in your fridge or from the supermarket. Ice cream can also come to in a truck known as an ice cream truck, which notifies with song when it is near.
			Although Ice cream is nice it does not work for every season unlike pizza because ice cream's flavour isn't good enough to withstand the cold when you 
			eat it in winter. One thing thing that I really like ...</p>

			<h3>Biltong</h3>
			<br>
			<p class='minitext'> Biltong is a dried, cured meat that originated in Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe and South Africa. Biltong is the best out of my three
			favourite foods. Biltong is very similar to beef jerky, which is also </p>
		</div>
		<div class='textboxDivtwo'>
			<p class='minitexttwo'>nice, but the ingredients and production of biltong are different to beef jerky 
			and I think the biltong variant is the better one. I think biltong is most famous in South Africa, which is where I was born and made me exposed to it.
			Biltong consists of the ingredients of meat, vinegar, black pepper, coriander and salt. I think the best type of meat to use for biltong is wildebeest
			but the worst type is fish ...</p>
