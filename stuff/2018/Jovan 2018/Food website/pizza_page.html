		<p class='content'>I chose pizza because it has melted cheese, you can put pineapple on it, it is cheap and you make people bring it to you. I believe
		the best toppings you can get on a pizza is pineapple and ham. The pizza I'm referring to is known as the Hawaiian, which isn't the picture I'm displaying.
		I really like that people can order a pizza and then have someone deliver it to you but the delivery might take too long and your pizza might get cold,
		which is also good because pizza is good at any temperature. I also like that how you can choose what goes on your pizza. I especially love
		the melted cheese on pizza because I love melted cheese.</p>
