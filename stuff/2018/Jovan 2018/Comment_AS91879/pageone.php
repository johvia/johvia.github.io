		<p class='mainbody'>Archey is the sport, art, practice or skill of shooting arrows with a bow. The word archery comes form a Latin word "Arcus" meaning bow or arch. Archery has been used in combat and mostly in hunting. Nowadays it is used mainly in sport and recreational activity. When you are participating in archery is known as either an archer or a bowman. I was first introduced to archery when I was around 9 - 10 years old at my school to do it as a sport. I first used a compound bow to practice the sport but the school didn't provide all the supplies to do the sport properly because I wasn't provided with a sight, tab and arm guard. I only did it for a year at the school and I picked it up again in 2017 at a archery target range because I wanted to get back into it. I had gotten all the right equipment, I changed the type of bow that I'm using to a recurve bow and I was doing it as regular sport until near the end of the year where I took a break. It is no July 2018 and I'm going get off my butt and stop my half-year break. I do want to try bow hunting and bow-fishing one day just to see how it differs from target archery. Currently, when looking at the world archery ranking, the top recurve archers are Chang Hye Jin and Kim Woojin.
