Mechanics game is going to need

inventory system
item generator
player stats
a saving system
	-possible with json


Notes
def going to use objects

/////
Well that was a f*ing lie.

I used Jquery instead though I do still use objects for my enemies. Player doesn't have stats but has an inventory.
Why would I think of an item generator. I would need sprites for them.
no Mechanics or physics in it.
IT has become so depressing because I can't do my own thing without being bothered.
